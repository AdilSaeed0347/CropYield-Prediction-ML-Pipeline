# Crop Yield Prediction ML Pipeline

## Description
This project implements a **Machine Learning pipeline** to predict crop yield based on weather conditions, soil quality, and fertilizer inputs. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training with multiple algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

The goal is to provide accurate crop yield predictions and insights into important factors affecting yield.
